his paper addresses the problem of victim item deletion based sensitive pattern hiding using PSO.,IPM,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization
"In VIDPSO algorithm, victim items are chosen based on their participation in sensitive patterns. The priority is given to the item appearing in more number of sensitive patterns. Hence, the deletion of one victim item from a specified number of transactions masks more than one sensitive pattern. Therefore, it incurs less data loss.",IPM,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization
"In the dense dataset, the support count values of itemsets are generally high. Therefore, a large number of transactions need to be deleted to hide sensitive itemsets, which causes high misses cost and data loss. The proposed algorithm hides the sensitive patterns from dense datasets with less data loss and misses cost.",IPM,Algorithms/ Methods Construction or Optimization
"The deletion of transactions reduces the size of the dataset and also the value of minimum support count. So, it does not reduce the support count of itemsets large enough to convert sensitive frequent itemsets into infrequent ones, which leads to high hiding failure, especially in dense datasets. Hence, VIDPSO proves to be an effective algorithm to hide sensitive itemsets.",IPM,Performance Evaluation

We reformulate the problem of encoding a multi-scale representation of a sequence in a language model by casting it in a continuous learning framework. We propose a hierarchical multi-scale language model in which short time-scale dependencies are encoded in the hidden state of a lower-level recurrent neural network while longer time-scale dependencies are encoded in the dynamic of the lower-level network by having a meta-learner update the weights of the lower-level neural network in an online meta-learning fashion.

"We present a set of experiments to demonstrate that deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) learn internal representations that capture soft hierarchical notions of syntax from highly varied supervision. We consider four syntax tasks at different depths of the parse tree; for each word, we predict its part of speech as well as the first (parent), second (grandparent) and third level (great-grandparent) constituent labels that appear above it. These predictions are made from representations produced at different depths in networks that are pretrained with one of four objectives: dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, machine translation, or language modeling. In every case, we find a correspondence between network depth and syntactic depth, suggesting that a soft syntactic hierarchy emerges. This effect is robust across all conditions, indicating that the models encode significant amounts of syntax even in the absence of an explicit syntactic training supervision",ACL,Model Construction or Optimization
